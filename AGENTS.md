# Working in this repo

Rudder records the prompts you give your AI coding assistants and turns a day's
worth of them into a readable digest. It installs hooks into Claude Code and
Codex that log each prompt to a local SQLite DB at `~/.rudder/rudder.db`.

## Layout

- `src/` — TypeScript sources (run directly via Node's type stripping in dev).
  - `db/` — Drizzle schema/client, generated-migration runner, prompt queries,
    and the custom `node:sqlite` driver.
  - `hooks.ts` — Claude/Codex `UserPromptSubmit` capture + learned-rule injection.
  - `transcript.ts` — bounded, fail-open reading of Claude/Codex JSONL session tails.
  - `compiler.ts` / `rules.ts` — TRACE-inspired rule compilation, lifecycle,
    storage, retrieval, and prompt context rendering.
  - `classify.ts` — the single source of truth for the category/reaction rubric.
  - `tagger.ts` — classifies untagged prompts via the agent CLI (`ensureTagged`/`tagDay`).
  - `tags.ts` — tag queries + `statsForDay()` (the numbers the dashboard *and* digest read).
  - `agent.ts` — shared `runAgent`/`resolveAgent` shell-out to `claude`/`codex`.
  - `digest.ts` — renders the Markdown digest; numbers come from `statsForDay`, the LLM only writes prose.
  - `serve.ts` / `ui.ts` — the `rudder start` daemon and its inlined dashboard page
    (also a PWA: `ui.ts` exports the manifest + service worker, served by `serve.ts`).
  - `icon.ts` — zero-dependency PNG app-icon generator (built-in `node:zlib`).
  - `install.ts` — `rudder init` (DB + hook wiring).
- `bin/rudder.ts` — CLI entry point.
- `dist/` — compiled output, the only code that ships (see `files` in `package.json`).
  Dev runs `bin/rudder.ts`; the published package runs `dist/bin/rudder.js`.
- `test/` — `node --test` suites.

## Stats pipeline (dashboard + digest)

Per-prompt classification is the single source of the numbers, so the live
dashboard and the digest can never disagree:

- Each prompt is tagged exactly once (`prompt_tags`, keyed by `prompt_id`) with a
  `category` (architecting/tuning/bugfixing/housekeeping/ignored) and a `reaction`
  (agree/disagree/none), using the shared rubric in `classify.ts`.
- Tagging is **out-of-band**, never in the capture hook: the hook inserts the
  prompt and fires a best-effort `POST /notify` at the `rudder start` daemon,
  which debounces (~1.5s) and batches a single agent call. If the daemon is down,
  the prompt is just left untagged and backfilled by the next `rudder start`,
  `rudder tag`, or `rudder digest`.
- `statsForDay()` aggregates tags into percentages (untagged rows count as
  `ignored` and are excluded from the denominator, so the four percentages sum
  to ~100% of counted prompts). `rudder digest` calls
  `ensureTagged` then fills `{{CORRECTION_LINE}}`/`{{PCT_*}}` tokens with those
  exact numbers — the LLM is told not to reclassify or recompute.
- `TAGGER_VERSION` in `tags.ts`: bump it to invalidate existing tags (rows at an
  older version count as untagged and get reclassified). Bump it whenever the
  rubric or prompt rendering changes in a way that should re-tag history.
- The tagger inherits `RUDDER_DISABLE=1` via `runAgent`, so classifying a prompt
  never records the classification instruction as a new prompt.

## Learned-rules pipeline

Both Claude Code and Codex use native `UserPromptSubmit` hooks. The hook records
the prompt, reads a bounded transcript tail for prior-turn evidence, queues a
`trace_events` row, and injects already-compiled project/global rules as
`additionalContext`. Compilation never runs in the hook: `rudder start`
debounces it out-of-band, and `rudder rules` can run it explicitly.

The compiler resolves atomic rules with `NEW`/`NOOP`/`UPDATE`/`SUPERSEDE`.
`memory_rules` keeps immutable versions and `rule_evidence` preserves
provenance. Prompt-time retrieval is a local SQLite query; no LLM runs on the
hot path.

## Local development

```
npm install        # install dev deps (typescript, @types/node, ...)
npm run db:generate # regenerate drizzle/ migrations after src/db/schema.ts changes
npm run typecheck   # tsc --noEmit
npm test            # node --test
npm run build       # rm -rf dist && tsc -p tsconfig.build.json
```

Always run `npm run typecheck` and `npm test` before committing. `prepublishOnly`
runs typecheck + test + build, so a broken tree cannot be published.
When the Drizzle schema changes, run `npm run db:generate` and commit the
generated `drizzle/` migration artifacts; runtime DB initialization applies those
migrations instead of hand-written bootstrap SQL.

### Gotcha: dev vs. published paths

Code that resolves file paths relative to itself must work in **both** layouts:
the `.ts` source tree (dev) and the compiled `.js` under `dist/` (published).
`rudderArgv()` in `src/install.ts` is the canonical example — it derives the bin
extension from the running module so `rudder init` writes a hook pointing at a
file that actually exists in each case. Mismatching this silently breaks prompt
capture (the hook fails and the fail-safe wrapper swallows the error).

## Pull request process

1. Branch off `main` (never commit directly to `main`).
2. Make the change; run the package checks via the `check-changed-folders` skill
   (Codex equivalent of `/check`) — or directly: `npm run typecheck`, `npm test`,
   `npm run build`.
3. If the change is user-facing or fixes a bug, bump the version in the same PR:
   `npm version patch --no-git-tag-version` (use `--no-git-tag-version` so the
   tag is cut later from `main`, not from the feature branch).
4. Commit, push, and open a PR with `gh pr create --base main`.
5. After the PR opens, address any review comments with the `address-pr-comments`
   skill (Codex equivalent of `/address-pr-comments`).

## Continuous integration

`.github/workflows/test.yml` runs `npm ci`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm test`, and
`npm run build` on every push. It is the gate that keeps `main` green; make it a
**required status check** in branch protection so untested code can't merge.
Testing deliberately lives here, separate from the publish flow (the archer
`testing.yml` split) — `publish.yml` only builds and publishes.

`.github/workflows/release-alert.yml` runs on every PR targeting `main` and posts
a **sticky PR comment** when merging will publish package artifacts or create a
GitHub Release. It mirrors `publish.yml`'s checks — npmjs.org is gated by the
`v<version>` tag, and GitHub Packages plus GitHub Releases are checked directly so
an existing npmjs.org release can be backfilled there. The comment is updated in
place on each push (via a hidden `<!-- release-alert -->` marker) rather than
duplicated.

## Publishing packages and releases

Publishing is **automatic on merge to `main`** — there is no manual tagging step.
`.github/workflows/publish.yml` runs on every push to `main` as a single job whose
steps:

1. compute `v<version>` from `package.json`.
2. publish to npmjs.org if that tag does not exist, using a **Trusted Publisher
   (OIDC)** — there is no `NPM_TOKEN` secret. The release path does **not** run
   tests itself — that's `test.yml`'s job (see CI above). `npm publish` still runs
   `prepublishOnly` (typecheck + test + build) as an intrinsic guard, so a broken
   tree can't ship.
3. publish to GitHub Packages via `GITHUB_TOKEN` if that registry is missing
   `@vivekyy/rudder@<version>`. The `repository` field in `package.json` links the
   GitHub package back to this repo so it appears under the repo's Packages.
4. push the `v<version>` tag as the npmjs.org "shipped" marker, **after** npmjs.org
   publishes successfully and GitHub Packages is satisfied (so a failed publish
   leaves no tag and a re-run retries cleanly).
5. create the GitHub Release for `v<version>` if it is missing, using
   `gh release create --generate-notes` so the release description is autogenerated
   from GitHub's release notes generator.

So the only way to publish a new npmjs.org release is to land a version bump
(`npm version patch --no-git-tag-version`, see the PR process) on `main`.
Forgetting to bump means no new npmjs.org publish (safe); the workflow can still
backfill GitHub Packages or a missing GitHub Release for an already-tagged version.

After a version-bump PR merges, verify the `Publish packages and releases` workflow
succeeded, `npm view @vivekyy/rudder version` reflects the new release, the package
appears under the repo's GitHub Packages, and the GitHub Release exists with
autogenerated release notes.

Notes:
- **The OIDC workflow is `publish.yml`** (unchanged from before). The Trusted
  Publisher at npmjs.com -> package -> Settings -> Trusted Publisher must name
  `publish.yml` — which is what it already is, so no reconfiguration is needed.
- The git tag is created **after a successful npmjs.org publish**, so it is a
  marker, not the trigger. Do **not** push `v*` tags by hand — and never run
  `npm version patch` on `main` (it would bump a second time).
- If a publish ever fails midway (e.g. a transient npm error), no tag is written;
  re-run `Publish packages and releases` from the Actions tab (`workflow_dispatch`)
  and it retries the missing registry and release artifacts.

## Installing / re-wiring hooks

`rudder init` creates the DB and installs native `UserPromptSubmit` hooks for
Claude Code (`~/.claude/settings.json`) and Codex (`~/.codex/hooks.json`). Both
point at the absolute bin path of the rudder that ran `init`.

Because each Conductor/git worktree is a separate checkout but `~/.claude/settings.json`
is global, a hook pointing into a specific worktree breaks once that worktree is
deleted. Prefer a **global install** (`npm i -g @vivekyy/rudder`) so the hook
points at a stable path (`/opt/homebrew/bin/rudder`) that survives worktree churn.

## Skills

### Available skills

- check-changed-folders: Run typecheck/test/build for the package on the current
  branch and enforce Claude/Codex sync. Use for `/check` requests and pre-PR
  validation. (file: .codex/skills/check-changed-folders/SKILL.md)
- address-pr-comments: Fetch open review comments on the current branch's PR,
  dedupe them, and fix/decline/defer each with a written reason. Invoked
  automatically by `check-changed-folders` when a PR exists. (file:
  .codex/skills/address-pr-comments/SKILL.md)

### Trigger rules

- If the user asks to run checks/tests/lint for the branch or references `/check`,
  use `check-changed-folders`.
- If the user asks to address PR comments, fix Greptile findings, or references
  `/address-pr-comments`, use `address-pr-comments`.
